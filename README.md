# Medical-Words-List-and-Password-Generator
For those who want a txt file of medical words, I got you. All prescription pharmaceutical drugs or medications in a txt file, I got you. Feel free to download either txt file for the lists.

This project is a password generator that uses medical word or drugs. 

The idea comes from several places, but it's quite simple, if the security of a words only password is (the rank of the least popular word)^(number of words) then by using medical words it should be more secure.

# HOW TO RUN

If you want to generate a medical/drug password, just run it like any python file, in terminal or command prompt type

python (path)/Medical_Password_Generator.py

If you want to re-scrape harvard or drugs.com for the txt files, you can as well, but I'd reccomend just downloading them from the repo.
